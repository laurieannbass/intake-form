//what will come here is the models
//note you'll want to divide up the fields so that 
//things can be changed quickly.  As if there was an 
//admin to add or remove.  This will be a hard coded model
// this is to overcome your issue of scope creap that has 
//over taken the intake form.

/*
Example:

'training__reimbursement' => array(
								'type'=>'checkbox',
								'options'=>array(
									'class_cost'=>'Tuition reimbursement for classes taken on employeeâ€™s own time',
									'materials'=>'Pay for textbooks or other class materials',
									'time'=>'Pay for employees\' time while at training',
									'online_cost'=>'Pay cost of on-site training',
									'none'=>'None',
									'other'=>'Other'
								)
							)	
//this wil be split up
